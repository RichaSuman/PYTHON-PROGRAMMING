git status # status on repo
git add hello.py
git commit -m "creating hello.py"
git status # after each step to know the status
git push -f origin main # If the git push  fails, try using `+` instead of `-f`. This will force the upload the files on git server

# Git log shows you the history of the commits that you have made up to this point
git log

# To change where we are in our history, we will use the git checkout command to tell Git which SHA we want to look at
git checkout 946b99bfe1641102d39f95616ceaab5c3dc960f9

git checkout -b my_new_feature
# Switched to a new branch 'my_new_feature'

# Git has a built-in way to compare the state of two branches so you don’t have to work so hard. It’s the show-branch command
git show-branch my_new_feature master
git show-branch --sha1-name my_new_feature master

# There are three main ways to get commits from one branch to another: merging, rebasing, and cherry-picking

# Now, we want to get that commit 4a4f449 to be on master. Check out master and run the git merge command there
1. git merge
    git checkout master
    # Switched to branch 'master'

    git merge my_new_feature

    # If the same section of code has been modified in both branches, Git can’t figure out what to do. 
    # When this happens, it stops the merge part way through and gives you instructions for how to fix the issue. This is called a merge conflict.

2. Cherry-Picking
    git show-branch --sha1-name my_new_feature master
    # Then cherry-pick the commit
    git cherry-pick 4a4f4492ded256aa7b29bf5176a17f9eda66efbb 


# Working with Remote Repos
# Git clone is the command you use when you have the address of a known repository and you want to make a local copy.
git clone
#
git fetch
git pull -u origin main
git push -u origin feature
    
# Summary
git status - Make sure your current area is clean.
git pull - Get the latest version from the remote. This saves merging issues later.
# Edit your files and make your changes. Remember to run your linter and do unit tests!
git status - Find all files that are changed. Make sure to watch untracked files too!
git add [files] - Add the changed files to the staging area.
git commit -m "message" - Make your new commit.
git push origin [branch-name] - Push your changes up to the remote.
