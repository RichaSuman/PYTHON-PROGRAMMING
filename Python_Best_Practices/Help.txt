Linters
    Linters are programs that analyze code and flag errors. 

    Some good linters for Python code are pycodestyle, flake8, and ruff

    Another popular option for linting your Python code is flake8. 
    Itâ€™s a tool that combines other projects, such as error detection using pyflakes, with pycodestyle.

    Another popular linter for your Python code is pylint.

    pip install pycodestyle
    pip install flake8

# AUTO-FORMATTERS

    Two other autoformatters, autopep8 and yapf, perform actions that are similar to what black does.
    Ruff also supports autoformatting.

    pip install black
